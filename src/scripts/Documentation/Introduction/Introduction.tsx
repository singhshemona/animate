      <h1>Welcome to the Animations Library!</h1>
      <p>
        Throughout my time freelancing and on the job, there have been a pattern of requests to include particular
        animations. In this library, I have included those most often requested as well as some that I thought would
        just be a fun challenge to build. Take and customize what you need.
